The dashboard provides a clear and structured view of road accident statistics, helping users understand:
- Total number of accidents
- Severity distribution (Fatal, Serious, Slight)
- Monthly and yearly accident patterns
- Key contributing factors 
- Geographic accident distribution 
This project demonstrates the use of interactive charts, filters, KPIs, maps, and visual storytelling in Tableau.
